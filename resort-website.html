      <h2>About us</h2>
        <p> Travels first began operations in March 2009 as registered business entity offering only air ticketing as a service. By then we had a small office at Branton Court, Ngong Road, before realizing steady growth of the company from a single employee, the Director Mr. Kizito Mwenesi, to having 10 employees and two offices within Nairobi which has seen us attract more and more clients within the Industry due to our competent service delivery and due diligence when dealing with our customers. We believe that we have the capacity to further grow our client base and expand our reach within the region thus we stay committed to maintaining highly ethical business practices and ensuring that our clients get the most value out of us. We now offer a wide variety of complementary services, having widely developed a supplier network, that ensures you do not have to look elsewhere for any of your travel needs.</p>
